The aim of this paper is to analyze the ”California’s Housing Price” Kaggle’s dataset in order to develop suitable predictive models, the definition of data clusters and any a-priori relationships between variables. In particular, for achieving these purposes, I have used the following techniques:
 * Forward Stepwise
 * Ridge Regression
 * LASSO Model
 * Partial Least Squares (PLS) 
 * Principal Component Analysis
 * K-means Clustering
