# Statistical-Learning
The aim of this paper is to analyze the ”California’s Housing Price” Kaggle’s dataset in order to develop suitable predictive models, the definition of data clusters and any a-priori relationships between vari- ables. In particular, for achieving these purposes, in the first part the following Supervised Learning techniques will be used:
 * Forward Stepwise
 * Ridge Regression
 * LASSO Model
 * Partial Least Squares (PLS) 
and then a comparison between the mean square errors provided by these models will be performed. Afterwards, in the second part, other two Unsupervised Learning techniques will be implemented:
 * Principal Component Analysis
 * K-means Clustering
for visually evaluating the behavior of the data. In the end, it is provided a conclusion of the analysis performed.
